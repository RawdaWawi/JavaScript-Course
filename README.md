# JavaScript-Course

This course gave me a solid foundation in web development, teaching practical skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
These skills are directly applicable to creating interactive websites, user interfaces, and personal projects like my portfolio site. Hands-on projects such as the Tic Tac Toe game, calculator, and pizza menu helped me apply theory to real-world tasks, enhancing my problem-solving and debugging abilities. 
Learning JavaScript was especially valuable since it’s essential for modern web development and a stepping stone to frameworks like React and Angular.
These skills are crucial for my career goals in software and web development, whether in front-end, full-stack, or automation roles.
I found great satisfaction in building functional applications from scratch and solving coding challenges.
The course’s focus on practical assignments strengthened my confidence and provided a strong base for future learning.
